                Morse code is a communication system that uses dots (•) and dashes (—) to represent letters and numbers.
                It was created by Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail in the 1830s for sending messages over the telegraph. It
                allowed long-distance communication before telephones existed and is still used in emergencies
            </p><br>
            <p id="p2">Morse code began in the early 1830s, when Samuel Morse, an American artist turned inventor, was searching
                for a way to send messages faster than mail could travel. Working with Alfred Vail, he developed a
                system that used short and long signals — later called dots (•) and dashes (—) — to represent letters
                and numbers. In 1837, they paired this code with the electric telegraph, allowing messages to travel
                instantly through wires.

                The first real demonstration happened in 1844, when Morse famously tapped out the message:
                "What hath God wrought"
                across a telegraph line from Washington D.C. to Baltimore.
                This moment sparked a communication revolution.

                From there, Morse code spread worldwide — used in war communication, ships at sea, and early radio. Even
                in emergencies today, the world still remembers the most iconic Morse signal:
                <br>SOS → • • • — — — • • •
